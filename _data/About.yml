  - description: From a young age, Ive pursued problem-solving through competitive robotics and competitive trading card games. Analyzing meta-game shifts and making optimal plays under pressure has taught me strategic thinking and adaptability. This mindset has naturally translated to my career as a software developer where I approach coding challenges with the same satisfaction as executing game-winning strategies, focusing on elegant solutions that balance technical excellence with practical usability. My gaming background has enhanced my professional skills: pattern recognition helps with debugging, learning card interactions parallels mastering new technologies, and the community aspect has taught me collaborative problem-solving. I have been a “go to” problem-solver in my group software projects as well! When not coding or playing cards, I recharge through golf and long walks which provide fresh perspectives for creative solutions. I'm always eager to connect with like-minded professionals who share my passion for technology and continuous improvement to collaborate on boundary-pushing projects.
